# Github Code Contributions

A Node script that outputs a JSON document of Github Pull Requests, made in a certain time period, by a set of Github users. It uses the Github API.

I tried to make it also list all our commits, but unfortunately [this does not seem possible, unless the time period is within the last 90 days](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/).
